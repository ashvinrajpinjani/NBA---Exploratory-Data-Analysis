# NBA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis


Our objective is to comprehensively explore the relationship between player salaries and a team's success. This analysis takes into account various factors, such as win percentages, individual player statistics, and overall team performance. Through this examination, we aim to uncover the fundamental drivers behind a team's triumph in the NBA.

The first dataset we have is from HoopsHype (https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2022-2023/), a basketball news and rumors website. 
The second dataset, obtained from Kaggle, provides a wealth of player attributes, including information such as their age, position, points scored, team affiliation, fouls committed, and field goals made.
